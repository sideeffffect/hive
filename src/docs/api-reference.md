# Dashboard REST API reference

Pragmatic v1 endpoint index compiled by hand from route registrations in `src/pkg/dashboard/*.go` and `src/pkg/hub/*.go` (tests excluded). There is no generator; update this page in the same change that adds or renames a route. It lists method, path, coarse auth level, and one-line purpose. Request/response schemas are intentionally not hand-written here; see the handler source for exact payloads and validation.

Auth levels are derived from dashboard middleware (`isPublicPath`, dashboard token/session auth, and the `/api/v1` GitHub-token wrapper) or from hub route wrappers such as `requireAuth` (rows marked `Hub auth`) and `requireAdmin` (rows marked `Hub admin`). Hub rows marked handler-specific have no dashboard middleware; check the named handler for bearer secrets, admin checks, or public behavior.

## Health, status, events

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/version` | Dashboard auth/session | Build/version metadata; includes `upgradeMarker` (`target`, `current`, `attempts`, `maxAttempts`, `failed`, `requestedAt`, `lastError`) while a self-upgrade is in flight or has failed ([#6765](https://github.com/hivecommons/hive/issues/6765)), and an `autoUpdate` object (`enabled`, `state` — one of `disabled`/`up_to_date`/`behind`/`retrying`/`failed`/`unknown` — `healthy`, `period`, `targetBranch`, `targetCommit`, `currentCommit`, `commitsBehind`, `lastAttemptAt`, `lastError`, `detail`) that never reports a failed or unknown update as healthy ([#6962](https://github.com/hivecommons/hive/issues/6962), [#6963](https://github.com/hivecommons/hive/issues/6963)) | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:55` |

| `GET` | `/api/runs` | Dashboard auth/session | Active staged runs projected from task leases, plans, and lifecycle timeline. Returns an array of `Run` objects: canonical `key` (`owner/repo#number`), current-stage `lease_key`, `title`, `repo` (`owner/repo`), `stage`, `gen`, `stage_started_at`, `waiting_on` (`agent`, `remote`, `human`, `ci`, `none`), `waiting_since`, `assignee`, `last_receipt`, `plan_epic_id`, and `stages[]` (`name`, `status`, `gen`, `receipt`). | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:87` |
| `GET` | `/api/runs/audit` | Owner only | Read-only cross-repo audit query over existing retained artifacts. Query `repo`, canonical `run` (`owner/repo#number`), RFC3339 `since`/`until`, `kind`, `limit` (default 100, max 500), and `page_token`. Returns `{items,next_page_token,retention}`; each item has `source` (`audit_log`, `timeline`, `lease_receipt`, `plan_epic`), `kind`, `run`, `repo`, `at`, `actor`, `artifact_id`, `attrs`, or an explicit `kind=expired,status=expired,state=Unknown` marker when requested history may have aged out. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:88` |
| `POST` | `/api/runs/audit` | Owner only | Activate the convergence audit campaign over a scope directory. Body `{"campaign_key":"audit-campaign","scope_dir":"/data/convergence/audit/scope","store":"audit","generation":1,"run_key":"","run_url":""}`; `scope_dir` defaults to `/data/convergence/audit/scope`, `store` defaults to `audit`, `auditor`, `scanner`, `supervisor`, then the first configured bead store. Runs inspection even when `publication.enabled` is false, but then skips the publisher and returns `publication_skipped:true` with reason `publication.disabled`. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:89` |
| `GET` | `/api/runs/{key}/checkpoint` | Dashboard auth/session | Compact mobile/chat checkpoint review payload for a held run. Returns `run_key`, `stage`, lease `gen`, `repo`, `title`, capped plain-text `summary`, approve/reject `decisions`, dashboard deep link, `lease_gen` staleness fence, and verified-owner approver rule. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:91` |
| `POST` | `/api/runs/{key}/checkpoint` | Owner only | Resolve a compact checkpoint decision. Body `{"action":"approve"|"reject","gen":<lease generation>}`; refuses stale generations with 409 and non-owner callers with 403 before mutating the plan. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:92` |
| `GET` | `/api/runs/{key}` | Dashboard auth/session | One run by URL-escaped canonical run key (`owner/repo%23number`); early lease-shaped keys (`repo!run-key:stage`) and queued Wavefront run-stage keys (`owner/repo!graph:node`) are also accepted. Includes timeline-derived stage history in the same `Run` shape as `/api/runs` when a lease/timeline exists. History entries that came from an owner reset carry the owner's `reason`. When the key belongs to a wired convergence campaign, the detail response also includes an optional `burndown` block with `source`, `satisfied`, `remaining`, `unknown`, and `scope`; the list endpoint omits this block. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:93` |
| `POST` | `/api/runs/{key}/reset` | Owner only | Move a run's lease back to an earlier stage (for example `implement` to `plan` after a rejected plan). Body `{"to": "<stage>", "reason": "<why>"}`, both required. Mints a new generation so the relay holding the old one can no longer resume, persists before answering, and records the reason on the agent audit sink, the lifecycle timeline, and the `stage_completed` hook payload (`attrs.reset = "true"`). Returns `{ok, key, stage_from, stage, gen, reason}`. 400 for the same or a later stage or a missing reason, 404 when no live staged lease holds the key, 409 when the lease expired, 500 when the registry could not be written. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:94` |
| `GET` | `/api/campaigns` | Dashboard auth/session | List resumable campaigns from archived Inception sessions and retained Spektacular (Spek) runs. Query `search`/`q`, `repo`, `stage`, `status`, and `owner`; each campaign is keyed by stable spec/session id and includes title, source, repos, current stage/step, artifact links, linked issues/PRs, contributors, last activity, status, engine, type, and run link when applicable. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:95` |
| `GET` | `/api/campaigns/{id}` | Dashboard auth/session | Return one campaign by URL-escaped stable campaign id or run key, using the same campaign shape as `/api/campaigns`. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:96` |
| `POST` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/resume` | Owner only | Resume or pick up a campaign. Archived Inception campaigns take a durable campaign lease, restore their saved state and wiki working files; Spek campaigns return the retained run detail plus a CLI status command that reloads state from Spek artifacts. Body may include `{ "surface": "chat"|"contributor"|"cli"|"dashboard" }`; 409 means another user holds the lease. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:97` |
| `POST` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/release` | Owner only | Release the caller's campaign lease and write a `campaign_release` audit entry so another user can continue the same campaign. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:98` |
| `POST` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/revise` | Owner only | Create a linked revision campaign (`revision_of`, `revision`) for revisiting shipped or parked Inception/Spek work without overwriting the previous campaign.

| `POST` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/jam/agents` | Maintainer only | Invite Spektacular or a configured hive agent into a Jam thread. The agent reply is posted as an attributed thread comment and an open suggestion for human accept/reject; no spec revision is auto-applied. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:104` |
| `GET` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/jam/suggestions` | Dashboard auth/session | List Jam suggestions with open/accepted/rejected status, proposed text, attribution and applied revision id when accepted. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:105` |
| `POST` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/jam/suggestions` | Read-write role; maintainer for accept | Create a suggestion (`section`, `proposed_text`) or resolve it with `action: "accept"`/`"reject"` and `suggestion_id`. Accepting records a new attributed spec revision. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:106` |
| `GET` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/jam/polls` | Dashboard auth/session | List Jam polls, advisory vote tallies and maintainer decisions stored against spec revisions. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:107` |

| `GET` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/jam/project-sync` | Dashboard auth/session | Return the campaign's GitHub Projects sync configuration, last published items, last status, and retry guidance for failures. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:109` |
| `POST` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/jam/project-sync` | Maintainer only | Enable/disable opt-in GitHub Projects sync, publish campaign specs/decisions/derived issues to the linked project, or record inbound project status updates without losing local Jam decisions. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:110` |
| `GET` | `/api/campaigns/{id}/jam/ws` | Dashboard auth/session | Upgrade to a Jam WebSocket for live participant presence, section focus, and conflict-aware spec co-edit messages. Live edits require read-write role and stale `base_revision_id` values are rejected with a conflict message. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:111` |
| `GET` | `/api/runs/{key}/trace` | Dashboard auth/session | Resolve `Hive-Run`, `Hive-Plan`, and `Hive-Spec` commit trailers for `?sha=...`, returning the linked plan section, spek clause, approval audit record, rationale audit entries, and typed no-linkage results when trailers are missing. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:90` |

### Kick is asynchronous

`POST /api/kick/{agent}` queues the message and returns immediately with `202`; it is not a delivery confirmation.

Delivery has to wait for the agent's CLI to present its input prompt, which is bounded by `inputPromptTimeout` (120s). Doing that wait on the request path made the handler outlive a typical 60s ingress idle timeout, so a proxy answered `504` for kicks that had in fact succeeded — the prompt was typed, the agent ran the session, and the operator was told it failed (kubestellar/hive#5325). Retrying a false failure delivered the prompt twice.

The contract is now:

- **`400`** — a genuine, deterministic precondition failure evaluated inline: unknown agent, paused, stopped, no tmux session, sandbox kick rejected, prompt over 10000 chars.
- **`202` with `status: "queued"`** — accepted; a background delivery started.
- **`202` with `status: "in-flight"`** — a delivery for this agent was already running, so this call was deduplicated. Delivery is exactly-once per agent, which is what makes an operator's retry harmless.

Read the result from `GET /api/kick/{agent}/status`, which returns `status` of `unknown`, `in-flight`, `delivered`, or `failed`, plus a `pending` boolean. While `pending` is true the outcome is **indeterminate** — the prompt may still be delivered — and clients must not render it as a failure. A CLI that never reaches its input prompt within `inputPromptTimeout` settles as `failed` with a reason.

## Packs and ACMM

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/packs` | Dashboard auth/session | Packs List | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:289` |
| `POST` | `/api/packs/{level}/apply` | Owner only | Pack Apply | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:290` |
| `PUT` | `/api/packs/level` | Owner only | Pack Set Level | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:291` |
| `POST` | `/api/repos/rescan` | Dashboard auth/session | Re-enumerate watched repositories' open issues/PRs for the dashboard Repositories cards. The scan is read-only with respect to agents/governor actions, collapses concurrent requests, and debounces repeated presses for 30 seconds (`repoRescanDebounce`) so the button cannot hammer GitHub | `pkg/dashboard/api.go`, `pkg/dashboard/api_repos_rescan.go` |
| `POST` | `/api/repos/pause` | Owner | Quiet ONE repository without stopping the hive: agents stop writing to it and stop being handed work on it, while it keeps its dashboard card and ACMM eval. Body `{"repo": "...", "reason": "..."}` — the repo travels in the body because a `project.repos` entry may be an explicit cross-org `owner/name`. Records who/when/why; `changed: false` marks a no-op re-pause and leaves the original provenance intact; `persisted: false` means the pause is in force but could not be written to config. Rejects a repo outside `project.repos`. See [per-repo agent pause](repo-pause.md) | `pkg/dashboard/api_repo_pause.go` |
| `POST` | `/api/repos/resume` | Owner | Lift a repository's pause. Unlike pause, does not require the repo to be in `project.repos`, so a pause left behind by a removed repo can still be cleared | `pkg/dashboard/api_repo_pause.go` |
| `GET` | `/api/repos/pauses` | Dashboard auth/session | Every repo pause with its provenance. Read-only — the same state is already on the repository cards | `pkg/dashboard/api_repo_pause.go` |


| `GET` | `/api/repos/{owner}/{repo}/hold-permission` | Dashboard auth/session | Reports whether the signed-in user can toggle hold chips for a repository card. Owners are allowed; otherwise the server checks GitHub `repos/{owner}/{repo}/collaborators/{user}/permission` and briefly caches the effective permission | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:305`, `pkg/dashboard/api_repo_hold.go` |
| `POST` | `/api/repos/{owner}/{repo}/items/{number}/hold` | Owner or repo write/maintain/admin | Add or remove a dashboard hold chip for an issue or PR. Body `{"held": true}` adds the hive's exact-match canonical `hive-pause/<hive-id>` label; `{"held": false}` removes exactly the labels causing the hold (`hive-pause/<hive-id>` and/or generic hold labels) and never removes `hive/<hive-id>` provenance. Every toggle writes an audit-log entry; the #8851 upgrade migration writes `/data/hive-hold-migration-<hive-id>.json` with audit-backed, provenance-only, and ambiguous legacy `hive/<hive-id>` classifications. | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:306`, `pkg/dashboard/api_repo_hold.go` |
| `GET` | `/api/acmm/evaluation` | Dashboard auth/session | ACMMEvaluation — combined codebase + operational result, cached server-side for 1 hour (`acmmEvalTTL`). `?refresh=1` (the dashboard's "🔄 Re-evaluate" button, #5877) bypasses the hourly TTL but is debounced server-side: requests within 1 minute of the last evaluation (`acmmRefreshDebounce`) still serve the cache, since a full refresh costs up to ~29 GitHub GetContents calls per repo. The response's `last_evaluated_at` timestamp reports when the cached evaluation was computed | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:308`, `pkg/dashboard/api_acmm_eval.go` |
| `POST` | `/api/acmm/issue` | Owner only | ACMMCreate Issue — files on GitHub or, with `governor.acmm.issue_tracker: work_source` / body `tracker: "work_source"` on a Linear-sourced hive, on Linear; response `tracker` says which. See [ACMM policy matrix](acmm-policy-matrix.md#where-acmm-gap-issues-are-filed) | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:309` |
| `GET` | `/api/acmm-recommendation` | Dashboard auth/session | Advisory level-up recommendation (`acmmadvisor.Recommendation`, JSON): never changes the applied level — see [ACMM advisor](acmm-advisor.md) | `pkg/dashboard/api.go:310` |

### `/api/v1` contributor subpaths

`handleAPIv1` dispatches authenticated contributor API calls below `/api/v1`.
Every request must carry a GitHub personal access token in the `Authorization`
header, using either the `Bearer <token>` scheme (hosted clients) or the
legacy `token <token>` scheme (what `gh auth token` and older hive CLIs
send). Both are accepted; the legacy scheme is retained for backward
compatibility. Credentials in the query string (`?token=`) are NOT supported
and are rejected, because query strings land in ingress and access logs. The
same rule applies to the shared dashboard owner token: send it in the
`Authorization` header, not in URLs. Dashboard terminal links use
`/api/terminal/handoff` to mint a ≤60-second single-use `code` for the browser
navigation instead of putting the owner token in the terminal URL.

Authorization: every `/api/v1` path except `/api/v1/me` additionally requires
the caller to be in the hive's authorized-users allowlist (any role), and
returns `403` otherwise — contributor, activity and knowledge data are
hive-private, not world-readable. `/api/v1/me` is exempt because it only
returns the caller's own profile. Client-supplied `X-Hive-User`, `X-Hive-Role`
and owner-verified headers are stripped at the top of the handler; identity is
always resolved server-side from the validated token.
